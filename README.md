# RoomPuzzleAdventure

A text-adventure game where you're stuck in a room and have to figure out how to get out. 

## Getting the game going

In one of your operating system's shell windows, navigate to the location of ``final.pl``. Then load up your favorite Prolog REPL. Of course, first go download one if you don't have one installed. 

Then, type ``consult('final.pl').`` to load everything into Prolog's database. 

Finally, simply type ``play.`` to get gaming!
